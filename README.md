# Cat or Dog Classifier

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Included Program
- **Binary Image Classification using CNNs**  
  Trains a convolutional neural network to distinguish between cat and dog images, a classic beginner-level computer vision task.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Prepare the dataset (typically, Kaggleâ€™s "Dogs vs. Cats").
3. Install the dependencies listed in the notebook.
4. Open the notebook with Jupyter or VSCode.
5. Train and evaluate the model.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
